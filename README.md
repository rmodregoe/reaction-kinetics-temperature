# Reaction Kinetics and Temperature Dependency

## Project Description
This project explores reaction kinetics and their dependency on temperature, focusing on reaction rates and ignition behaviors. Using MATLAB scripts, the project calculates reaction rate constants and visualizes key parameters such as propagation velocities and activation energies for different conditions.

## Features
- **Reaction Rate Analysis**:
  - Calculates reaction rate constants as a function of temperature.
  - Implements Arrhenius equations for multiple reactions.
- **Temperature Dependency**:
  - Analyzes how temperature affects reaction rates and ignition thresholds.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generates plots for reaction rate constants, temperature dependencies, and propagation velocities.

## Included Files
- `visualizationK.m`: Computes and visualizes reaction rate constants for multiple reactions.
- `propagation_velocities.m`: Simulates propagation velocities under varying conditions.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or higher.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rmodregoe/reaction-kinetics-temperature.git
   ```
2. Open the `.m` files in MATLAB.
3. Run individual scripts for analysis:
   - Reaction rate constant visualization:
     ```matlab
     run('visualizationK.m')
     ```
   - Propagation velocity simulation:
     ```matlab
     run('propagation_velocities.m')
     ```

## Results
- Outputs include plots of reaction rate constants as functions of temperature.
- Simulates propagation velocities and highlights the impact of temperature on reaction dynamics.
